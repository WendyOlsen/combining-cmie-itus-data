Combining CMIE-ITUS Data With Bayesian Estimation


Github address:  https://github.com/WendyOlsen/combining-cmie-itus-data/

This repository holds code and figures as well as appendix material for papers about combining-cmie-itus-data using Bayesian estimation methods. The papers look at time-use of women and men in India during a period 2019-2020 when a tertile (4-month interval) survey, CMIE was used to augment the Indian Time-Use Survey of 2019.  Both used large national samples, which had a multi-stage clustered and stratified selection procedure. The CMIE however did not have lists of village or town residents except insofar as they created such lists.  Therefore, their sampling method was different at the final stage within the final sampled geographic units.
